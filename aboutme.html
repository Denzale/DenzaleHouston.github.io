                My name is Denzale Houston, I am 22 years old. I am on the road to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. I am
                currently taught HTML, CSS, Javascript,
                JQuery, Node.JS, Git, Command and Ajax. Im currently enrolled in the University of Arizona Full-Stack Web
                Development Program.
                I am currently working for Banner Health as a transporter. I have built computers as a personal hobby.
                After I understood how a computer works, I wanted to learn how to think like a computer
                and test myself to learn something that will take me on a new jorurney.
              </p>

              <p class="about-text">
                Prior to working in the program I would self teach myself the basics of HTML and CSS to make side projects
                of things I personally
                found instresting. I would make personal webpages of my favorite video games or movies. Im intrested in
                video game development and
                animation. I like to create personal projects such as editing videos and music.
